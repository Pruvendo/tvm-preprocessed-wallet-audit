![Pruvendo logo](new_logo.jpg)

The present audit report has been prepared by [Pruvendo](https:://pruvendo.com) at 05/11/23

# Introduction

The present audit is conducted against 
[tvm-preprocessed-wallet](https://github.com/ever-incubator/tvm-preprocessed-wallet/blob/main/code.fif) contract with the code equals to the 
commit ```aebadc7ba6ff8fc7f99c98b22ec2197fd7e94038```.

The contract represents a simple TVM-based (applicable
for such blockchains as [TON](https://ton.org/) or [Everscale](https://everscale.network/)) wallet,
with the basic functionality and strongly optimized
in terms of gas spending.

# Executive summary

The audit result is **POSITIVE** and the contract is
recommended for moving into production.

# Methodology

While the present project is just an audit, without
formal verificattion of the code, the following light
technologies are being used:
- the whole workflow is manually analyzed step-by-step
- the possibility of typical attacks is analyzed
- manual check for optimized gas usage

# Workflow analysis

The following analysis is based of TVM Specification created by Nickolay Durov at 03/23/2020/ 
as well as [Fift documentation](https://test.ton.org/fiftbase.pdf). According to the code the
[ASM library](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/fift/lib/Asm.fif) is used.

The initial value of stack is described [here](https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-overview) and assumes five elements put on stack.
Only two of them are used and latter are ignored and
so skipped from the further consideration.

The valuable stack elements are:
- _selector_ - boolean:
    - _FALSE_ - for internal messages
    - _TRUE_ - for external messages
- _msg_ - slice that represents message body according
to the  Chapter _A.11.9_ of the TVM documentation mentioned
above as well as in section 3.1.7 of [Blockchain documentation](https://ton.org/tblkch.pdf)

The message body has the following parameters:
- data:
    - _sign_ - at least 512 bits representing signature
- ref:
    - _data_ - cell representing the rest of the message
        - data:
            - _until_ - 64-bits representing time until the message is valid
            - _num_ - 16-bits representing the message sequence number
        - ref:
            - _actions_ - the cell representing the code to be executed

Persistent data is a cell that contains two bit sequences with no references:
- _key_ - 256-bit sequence representing the private key of the contract owner
- _cur_ - the current value of the minimally accepted sequence number

# Analysis result

## Workflow analysis

The detailed workflow analysis provided above demonstrates that the contract works correctly and provides
the comprehensive checks for all the input 
parameteres, including the security ones.

## Attack analysis

The most common attacks for the wallet contracts are:

- Violation of security
- Replay attack

### Violation of security

The contract provides the correct process of checking the signature of the sender thus
eliminating this risk.

### Replay attack

The contract provides a defence against replay protection that is based on exact
equivalence of the expected message number and the message number provided.

Such a defence:
- prevents a replay attack
- prevents an attack based on counter increase (internal messages are blocked at the
beginning of the contract code while _ACCEPT_ is called after all the checks that eliminates the risk
of writing malicious data into the blockhain)

However, there is a risk the onwer loses the counter
and, thus, the assets become frozen.

## Performance and gas spending analysis

The developers chose to use almost pure TVM Assembler
(Fift environment is just a boilerplate that keeps the
final code intacted) that let them to apply some
exotic and efficent primitives such as _XCHG3_ or
_PUSHPOW2_ . All the doubtful cases (such as using
_PUSHPOW2_ together with _MOD_ instead of _PUSH_  and
_AND_ ) were analyzed and the auditors came to
conclusion that developers chose the optimal approach
in all the cases were considered.

# Issues found

The only issue that has been found is as follows:
if the owner somehow loses the message counter
(say, due to the poor Internet connection and
subsequent failure of transaction), he loses access
to its funds.

The auditors hope that it's supposed all the
transactions to be held via debots (out of the audit scope) and the latter eliminate this risk, so
the issue being discussed is prioritized as _MINOR_
and does not change the **positive** verdict.

# Audit outcome

As a result of the audit the auditors recommend the
contract to be deployed into production. The outcome
is **POSITIVE**.
